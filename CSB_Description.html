<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>Chaos Strikes Back Description</B></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos Strikes Back is the
sequel to Dungeon Master and used the same file formats and almost
the identical runtime engine.&nbsp; Chaos Strikes Back (commonly
called 'CSB') is very much like Dungeon Master and anyone who has
played Dungeon Master will instantly recognize it and feel completely
at home playing CSB.&nbsp; But first impressions are misleading.&nbsp;
CSB plays very differently.&nbsp; It is extremely non-linear.&nbsp;
This non-linearity goes beyond the common, simple, multiple-choice.&nbsp;
Like two ways to get from point A to point B.&nbsp; CSB is non-linear
in space and time.&nbsp; There is no particular order that most
things must be accomplished.&nbsp; There are commonly no particular
tasks that must be accomplished.&nbsp; There are a few (three or
four, again depending) keys you must get and a few places you must
visit but how you get them and how you get there is very much open to
your style of play.&nbsp; Moreover, many of the interesting objects
in the game are distributed at random so that you cannot play the
game twice the same.&nbsp; Even your own movements will appear to be
random until you figure out how the dungeon is built.&nbsp; This game
requires you to &quot;learn the ropes&quot; slowly by trial and error
and extended exploration.&nbsp; Very much different from Dungeon
Master, in which each hallway guided you to the next stairway.<BR><BR>This
game is extremely difficult.&nbsp; It comes with a &quot;Hint Oracle&quot;
that can provide some help.&nbsp; The Hint Oracle examines your saved
game to see where you are currently located in the dungeon and then
provides several hints, starting with a general sort of hint and
progressing to a complete 'Spoiler'.&nbsp; So you can choose how much
you want to be 'spoiled'.&nbsp; But even the most direct spoilers are
totally insufficient for a walk-through.&nbsp; You are going to have
to work hard to complete this game.&nbsp; There are many movies
available which show complete games.&nbsp; They vary in length from
20 minutes (yes, that's right.&nbsp; The game was played in less than
20 minutes.) to 14 hours.&nbsp; Very different styles of play are
represented.&nbsp; As a beginner, you will require much more than 14
hours to complete the game.<BR><BR>Toni Y played this game after not
having played it for a long time.&nbsp; In the process, he created an

two disks for the Atari.&nbsp; I think this was because of space
limitations on bothe the disk and Atari memory.&nbsp; At any rate,
the result is that the game is divided into two parts: 1) Selection
of champions and 2) Adventuring.&nbsp; Here is how to do the several
steps that must be done to play the game:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Selection of
	champions.&nbsp; Execute CSBwin.&nbsp; Select &quot;DUNGEON&quot;.&nbsp;
	At the Prison door, select &quot;Enter&quot;.&nbsp; You will be in
	the prison and you can walk around and select your Champions by
	clicking on their portraits.&nbsp; You can Resurrect them with their
	old capabilities or you can Reincarnate them and give them a new
	start in life with new names and titles.&nbsp; If you examine the
	walls carefully you may find some surprises and be able to pick up a
	Champion with special abilities.&nbsp; Once you have your party
	selected, you can save the game (right click in the viewport and
	click on the little floppy disk icon).&nbsp; Click on &quot;Save and
	Quit&quot; and give it one of four names.&nbsp; Terminate CSBwin
	with the 'File/Exit' menu.</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Creating a new game to
	play.&nbsp; Execute CSBwin.exe.&nbsp; Select &quot;UTILITY&quot;.&nbsp;
	This function take the party you selected in step 1) and places it
	in the dungeon to begin adventuring.&nbsp; Select the name of the
	game where you saved your party in step 1).&nbsp; You will see the
	portraits of all your party members.&nbsp; On the Atari, you could
	edit the protraits and do other no\ice things but when using CSBwin
	all you can do is &quot;Make New Adventure&quot;.&nbsp; So click on
	&quot;Make New Adventure&quot;.&nbsp; You will see a menu with the
	option to &quot;Make New Adventure&quot; again.&nbsp; Select &quot;Make
	New Adventure&quot; for the second time.&nbsp; Then select a name
	for the new game.&nbsp; You can use the same name as your party
	selection game if you wish.&nbsp; Then Click &quot;QUIT&quot; (on
	the PocketPC version, the word &quot;QUIT&quot; is hidden by the
	fact that the entire Utility screen is not shown.&nbsp; Instead, you
	can simply choose &quot;Exit&quot; from the &quot;File&quot; menu at
	the bottom of the screen).&nbsp; You now have a saved game that you
	can &quot;RESUME&quot;.</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adventuring.&nbsp;
	Execute CSBwin.exe.&nbsp; Select &quot;DUNGEON&quot;.&nbsp; Select
	&quot;RESUME&quot;.&nbsp; Select the name of the game you saved.&nbsp;
	The first time you start adventuring you will find yourself naked,
	in the dark, and surrounded by worms.&nbsp; At this point you may
	throw up your hands and go play Dungeon Master again.&nbsp; Getting
	out of this predicament requires some practice.&nbsp; Like
	everything in CSB.&nbsp; Practice, practice, practice.&nbsp; But it
	is easy.&nbsp; Just like riding a bicycle.&nbsp; Once you know how.&nbsp;
	There is an iron door in this room.&nbsp; Just in front of the door
	is a pressurepad that causes more worms to be created.&nbsp; Avoid
	that, for starters.&nbsp; There is a scounce (torch holder) that
	will open an alternative exit if you place a torch there.&nbsp;
	There is a trick wall that leads to some nicer clothes.&nbsp; End of
	spoilers.&nbsp; Good luck.</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT>Using the Hint Oracle.&nbsp; Execute CSBwin.exe.&nbsp;
	Select HINT.&nbsp; Select LOAD.&nbsp; Select the name of the saved
	game for which your party needs some hints.&nbsp; There are
	generally two types of hints: Descriptions of the creatures on the
	party's level and hints for the party's particular location in the
	dungeon.&nbsp; Pressing NEXT provides more detailed hints.</P>

</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&quot;I haven't played CSB
for many years but its etched forever in my nightmares.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&nbsp;-- a quote i can't
find, &quot;DM does... while CSB does ... &quot; - i'm sure Paul C
(slide) said it, but can't see it yet, still looking&nbsp; --</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>DM gently guided you in a linear fashion and introduced
you to puzzles, dungeoneering, monsters and its world. CSB slaps you
right into the centre of a complex non-linear dungeon of insane
interconnectivity. Naked. In the dark.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>The only way it could be worse is if you were poisoned
and wounded. Though of course since you are surrounded by worms and a
few moments from being completely trapped by them, then this isn't
far off in coming : )</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>That doesn't make this game bad. It makes it a shock.
But no matter how many times you get killed, which you will, and how
many times a puzzle infuriates you, which it also will, there is
something about the it that pulls you back in. The fact that it's the
sequel to beloved DM will keep you trying to start with. Then
actually starting to work out the logic of the dungeon keeps you
hooked.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>In DM you could carefully sculpt a party, watch it grow
and puzzle with the dungeon. In CSB you have powerful champions, what
you need to do it push them and yourself to the limits. This isn't a
game for someone who has never played DM. It is not necessarily a
game for someone who has mastered DM and fused Chaos every day for a
year either. Both experienced and not will&nbsp; find challenges, as
CSB rewards not just knowing how to take on four creatures at once
and swiftly cast fireballs without thought. The dungeon is so
different to DM that you start off in a similar place.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Realising the meaning of
puzzles. Realising the layout of the dungeon. Realising that you have
actually increased in skills in a game you thought you had mastered
with DM.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Gameplay - 9 - sometimes you just need to keep getting
killed and trying things again and again. Other times you just need
to persevere. Sometimes you need to be able to use all your fighting
skills, and other items you need to be able to spot the subtle
tricks. CSB tests all your skills.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Originality - 9 - it has the same decorations, many of
the same monsters, and is still the same endless grey walls. The fact
that there are new monsters and weapons makes a slight difference.
The fact that it is so different in logic and feel to DM is what
makes it completely fresh.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Difficulty - 10 - until you learn its logic, lack of
logic, and many secrets, you will die alot, and scream at areas alot.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Puzzles - 7 - there are some
nice ones. There are some hideously obscure ones. Figuring out the
DDD is nightmarish. It's sometimes luck if you manage</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>to gain the answer before you lose all sanity.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Size - 7 - its 10 packed levels, though you might not
appreciate it. Doesn't feel as large as DM once you master it.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Replayability - 10 - it's very non-linear with many
secrets, and you have the choice of DM or starting party or even
reincarnation for increasing difficulties for new challenges.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Craft - 9 - its exactly the
same engine. So some of the ways things done are genius. Such as
random object placement - there is no randomise function in</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>the engine. Pure dungeon mechanics. Some of the puzzles
too are clever and subtle.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Game Ending - 5 - a let down. The sense of satisfaction
and achieving it is the main thing. But there is no solid 'Fuse
chaos' ending. You destroy the last corbum and that is it. Game over.
Of course, there is a whole level to fight through to do that, so
it's not completely easy.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atmosphere - 5 - its very
disconnected. So while fun to solve, I have never felt a build up of
atmosphere in terms of story. But it does have very claustrophobic
atmosphere. You are never more than a few steps from danger.&nbsp; A
stairwell or false wall may be all that stands between you and
another</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">insane fight/puzzle.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Best part - solving the puzzles. Watching corbums burn.
The start once you realise how to get the most from it. The Neta path
(first half) 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Worst part - its not DM. You
don't get the linear story. Triggering floods and some insanely
complex mechanics and puzzles like the DDD.</P>
