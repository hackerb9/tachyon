OVERVIEW

This took me a lot longer than anticipated! The dungeon is fairly linear in structure though certain
areas can be completed before others depending on your team strength. I would say it was 60% DM, 30%
DM2 and 10% CSB in nature. There will be variation game to game due to the 'random item' mechanism
in the game. So where that nice sword you have been waiting for ends up, who knows? Obviously this 
mechanism doesn't apply to the important bits.
I found it hard to judge how difficult I should make the monsters, so there are a lot of puzzles. 
Same for the food quotas. Please report to me ASAP if you find this too easy hard and I may alter it 
a bit.
Finally I STRONGLY recommend you take at least two people as 1) There is a lot of stuff to carry and
2) Well, you'll find out...

STORY

The world had been a quiet and peaceful place for many years since the heroes of old had restored
harmony, and the Grey Lord and Librasulus ruled the land. But the Grey Lord was growing old and had 
decided to take on an apprentice to pass down his knowledge to keep the world a balanced place. The
apprentice listened with great wonder to his Master of the power of the mighty staff and its ability 
to divide the world into two. The temptation was too much... one cold and stormy night the apprentice
turned on his Master and forced him to rebuild the staff. The apprentice captured the Lord and held 
him prisoner in an old deserted tower. He took the staff and with its power drained all that was good
 and all that was bad from the lord and to his horror it created two powerful beings, Lord Order and Chaos.
Lord Chaos laughed an evil laugh and killed the foolish apprentice instantly. "I shall spread terror 
and destruction once again" cackled the Dark Lord and took the exhausted Grey Lord to the bottom of the
tower with the staff.
Lord Order was not amused, he wanted the staff himself so he sent a huge and powerful Dragon down to retreive
it. However the Dragon had other ideas... he swallowed the Grey Lord and the Staff and became even more
powerful! Order and Chaos then built a fort to keep people out and the Dragon in while they decided how to 
retrieve the one thing they both craved.

Librasulus sends you forth into the tower to kill the Dragon, rescue the Grey Lord and Firestaff and to restore balance
again to the universe! You can choose up to four champions of old. You will end up in the town somewhere
after choosing as you enter the void, though you may see a vision of evil on the way.
Good luck!

INSTRUCTIONS

This dungeon is run using CSBWin. Unpack and copy files into your CSBWin directory (inc CSBexe with this download). Click on the sword icon, and away you go! Enter prison to start game, which can be saved in one of four slots. CSBWin has many options in its pull down menus to configure game. A lot of the things are self explanatory, but are not essential. Screen size is best in x2 or x3 with a modern monitor (remember this is a conversion from the Atari code, and used a resolution of 320x200 so will look very blocky at full screen). Speed options simply accelerate the internal clock and is probably best left how it is. All other options please visit www.dungeon-master.com/forum for info
