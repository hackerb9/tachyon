TIPS:

The aim of this dungeon is to propose another experience of DM. Be prepared to have to learn it all again.
Many monsters are lethal with enhanced powers and AI. Think about new strategies!
Get a flask as soon as possible and try the spells.

The game is not linear. Though you may access almost any zone from the start, you shouldn't hurry to go downstairs. It is possible to reach the emerald level in a few minutes, but you wouldn't survive very long.

You were sent in the undercity with a very blur task: "to save the city". You should explore the undercity and figure what's going on. There is much more than just a main quest ending.

There are no starving-to-death traps. There is always an exit.


DIFFICULTY:
* Pick the 4 guides the first time to uncover many secrets.

*For a greater challenge, start with only one guide and try to get 3 guildmasters by venturing into the dungeon and earning guilds' grades.

*For the greatest challenge of all, start the game with the maleficient guild. Only for insane players. It is probably impossible to reach the ending. I repeat: difficulty=impossible. So don't complain if you try it!

*Unleash Hell for more difficulty. (hardcore gamers only!)
