KNOWN BUGS:
* Some monsters are higher than the walls and may be seen over them. They will look weird in doorframes.

* Some lesser graphic incoherences may appear at certain angles of vision. It would be very complex to get rid of them and has no effect on the game.

Comments and critics are welcome. I only can fix bugs I'm aware of!
