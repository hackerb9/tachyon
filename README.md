# TACHYON

Game engine based on Faster Than Light's "Dungeon Master". It can play
both FTL's _Dungeon Master_ and _Chaos Strikes Back_, plus homebrew DM
games including _Conflux III_, _The Black Flame_, _The Towers of
Chaos_, _3D2D1D_, and _5DMaze_. While primarily tested under
GNU/Linux, it is SDL based, and should work in Apple's MacOS, and
Microsoft Windows.

# Wait, this is just CSBwin!

Yes. And no. I have set up "main" of this repository to be simply a
mirror of Paul R. Stevens's [CSBwin](http://dianneandpaul.net/CSBwin/).
However, if you checkout the
[TACHYON branch](https://github.com/hackerb9/tachyon/blob/tachyon/README.md/),
you'll see the changes I've been making.
