# tachyon
Game engine based on Faster Than Light's "Dungeon Master". It can play both FTL's _Dungeon Master_ and _Chaos Strikes Back_, plus homebrew DM games including _Conflux III_, _The Black Flame_, _The Towers of Chaos_, _3D2D1D_, and _5DMaze_. While primarily tested under GNU/Linux, it is SDL based, and should work in Apple's MacOS, and Microsoft Windows.

# Wait, this is just CSBwin!
Yes. This is [Paul R. Stevens](http://www.dianneandpaul.net/)'s CSBwin. Although Mr. Stevens no longer wishes to maintain CSBwin, he is due all the credit for the heroic — verging on crazy — effort of porting the original Atari ST game to C++. 

Mr. Stevens has always said the source code is "free for anyone to do with as they like", so — with his consent — I have interpreted that to mean the MIT License. While the code he wrote is free, note that the data files are likely still under copyright.

"TACHYON" is just what I'm calling this little repository in which I can squash bugs, cleanup code, and add my wishlist features. The name comes from the theoretical physics and is a tip of the hat to Faster Than Light, the now defunct publisher of *Dungeon Master* and its sequel *Chaos Strikes Back*.
